Hi, I’m Yetunde Abegunde, an accomplished accountant with over five years of experience in financial management, accounts payable/receivable, and financial modeling. I specialize in streamlining key processes such as invoice management, payment runs, and reconciliations to drive efficiency and ensure accuracy. Proficient in tools like QuickBooks, Sage, Zoho Books, Xero, Power BI, and SQL, I excel in financial reporting, payroll, tax remittance, and fixed asset management.

Notable achievements include improving cash flow by efficiently tracking receivables to ensure timely customer payments, managing precise fund allocations for over 4,000 field agents, and contributing to seamless audits through meticulous financial record-keeping. I hold certifications in ACCA (Applied Skills Stage) and Financial Modeling and Valuation Analysis, backed by strong skills in attention to detail, problem-solving, and collaboration.
